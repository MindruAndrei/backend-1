    "text": "Dear Trustpilot Community,  I feel compelled to share my recent travel experience with Tarom Airlines, as it was nothing short of a nightmare. I hope that my review can shed light on the level of service and professionalism that this airline unfortunately lacks.  My journey with Tarom Airlines took place on 2 May 2023 from Belgrade to Bucharest. Little did I know that this trip would turn into a series of frustrations and disappointments that I have never encountered with any other airline.  The flight was marred by route changes and an unexpected delay that exceeded 10 hours. Throughout this ordeal, not a single representative was available to address passengers' concerns or provide updates. The complete lack of communication during this extensive wait was truly disheartening.  After hours of uncertainty, the flight was eventually canceled. We were directed to a hotel with promises of updates about the rescheduled flight via email. Additionally, we were informed that the airline would cover the costs of our taxi fares to return to the airport.  The next day, a mere 1.5 hours before the rescheduled flight departure time, an email informed us of the new flight details. Rushing to the airport in a bid to catch the flight showcased the lack of organization and planning on the airline's part.  As a seasoned traveler, I have never encountered such a lack of professionalism and accountability from an airline. The experience with Tarom Airlines was not only disappointing but also deeply frustrating, leaving me questioning the airline's commitment to its customers.  I am sharing this review on Trustpilot in the hope that it will serve as a cautionary tale for fellow travelers. Choosing an airline is a significant decision, and it is crucial to opt for one that values its passengers and ensures a smooth journey. Unfortunately, based on my experience, I cannot recommend Tarom Airlines to anyone seeking reliable and customer-focused travel.  My intention in sharing this review is to help others make informed decisions about their travel choices. I encourage all readers to consider alternatives and exercise caution when considering Tarom Airlines for their future travels.  Sincerely,",

My luggage did not arrive in Bucharest so I filed a claim (OTPRO29392), leaving the address for my luggage to be delivered to as my original destination. As a seasoned traveler, I know to pack a 72 hour supply of my meds, extra clothes and small size toiletries just to be prepared for the unexpected. Having not heard from the company for the next 2 days, I called the 3rd day and they informed me they indeed had my luggage but I shouldn't expect it until there were additional bags in my destination county (roughly 120 miles from Bucharest). I tried to explain to the clerk this was unacceptable, I was running out of medications (if the bag was completely lost I would understand but for it to be held hostage in the airport while I incurred additional expenses for no reason made no sense to me). The clerk replied I should expect this in Romania. I contacted TAROM by e-mail, no response over 24 hours later. Tried to file a complaint with ANPC (the BBB equivalent in Romania) but of course their website is malfunctioning (I probably should expect this as well in Romania). Now is day 5, I had to spend over $250 out of my pocket for items I had in my luggage). Once I get back home, I will contact Delta, as well as my credit card to see if I could get some of this covered. TAROM is truly the worst airline I've ever flown.",

The flight RO0362 was supposed to leave Amsterdam from 11:50 o' clock. The layover would be in Bucharest at 16:25. We should have arrived in Bucharest on 15:35. Unfortunately, the flight was delayed. The plane left one hour and 20 minutes later then scheduled (aprox. 13:10 o' clock) from Amsterdam Schiphol. This resulted in the event that we missed our connecting transferflight of 16:25 in Bucharest, because we arrived in Bucharest at 16:36. Because of all this, Tarom had to change our flight tickets to a flight from Turkish Airlines (TK1046). The issuing airline is Tarom. There was no plane leaving earlier to Istanbul.  Unfortunately, as if having one delay wasnt enough, this flight was also delayed. At arrivel at Bucharest airport it was also already known that this flight had a delay. But the delay eventually resulted in a scheduled flight from 21:40 and arrival time in Istanbul 23:00 to really departing at 2:05 at night and arriving at 3:21 at night time.  So, instead of arriving at 17:40 o clock in Istanbul as was purchased and scheduled in our flight tickets, we had to wait 9 hours and 40 minutes (!) at the airport in Bucharest. As a result of this, we have had hardly any sleep, we were exhausted, we haven't had one warm meal from Tarom (only sandwiches with cheese and water), we have medical complaints from the trip (feeling nauseated, feeling sick and lightheaded) and a very rough start what was supposed to be a relaxing holiday for us. Also my mother who suffors from chronic diseases and needs her sleep and dinner on time had to sleep on the cold floor at the airport, because we werent allowed at the business class lounge. Constantly the estimated departure time of the flight would get pushed back, this deprived us from getting any sleep because we had to be constantly awake to keep an eye at the gate for the actual departing time.",

    "text": "This is the worst airline I've ever used!!! I was flying from Bucharest to NYC via Belgrade. My first flight landed in Timisoara (TMR), a small city in Romania instead of Belgrade, around 10:30am. They said it was too foggy but all other flights that day managed to land on BEG so their reason is dubious. The aircraft was an ATR 42-500 which is really small, unstable, and old. Then, we ended up spending ~10hr in Belgrade, without any food, or information from Tarom representatives. I know they are obligated to give you food and water if the delay is longer than 2-3 hours. There were no representatives of any company to talk to in the TMR airport because we were at the gates and it is a very small airport. After realizing that I missed my connection from BEG to JFK, I called Tarom but they said that it is not their fault and they cannot do anything, they won't rerout me, and that I need to go to Belgrade and talk to AirSerbia (the company from which I bought my tickets). At ~4:30pm, after 6 hours of waiting, they decided that there will send a bus to take us from TMR to BEG (> 3hr of driving, while the OTP - BEG flight was ~1hr) and the plane will return to OTP and we have to make a decision of what to do. I would like to mention that the road death rate in Romania is of ~100 deaths / 1M people and that of flying is ~0 so it is absolutely unacceptable to ask us to take a bus to BEG, put our lives in such danger since we did not book a bus we booked a plane ticket!! I am also pretty sure this is illegal. They did not want to send another aircraft although they had the resources to do so. They promised the bus will leave around ~5pm but then said it won't leave until 6-7pm. It ended up leaving after 8pm. Realizing we would be arriving extremely rate to Belgrade and there won't be much support for us there (there were barely any flights to NYC in the next few days and all of them were extremely expensive. I would have preferred to do this before making my decision but they made us decide on the spot with no information of where and how we can get rerouted if we choose either option. AirSerbia told me that they cannot book on the phone and they cannot book a ticket if I go back to Bucharest with the flight which is insane given that the plane was the only way of transportation I had paid for. Anyway, around 7pm, I decided to not take the bus to Belgrade because I did not want to risk my life and get my own flight back and fight them via complaints and in court. I am pretty sure that not providing food, sending us with a bus instead of the plane, making us make such a decision, putting our lives in danger in this way, not rerouting me over the phone or from Bucharest is illegal!!",

    "text": "I bought my ticket (Bucharest-Athens) from Aegean Airlines which I am used to fly with, but the flight was - unfortunately - operated by Tarom, which meant I had to check-in from Tarom counters in the Bucharest airport. I had 3 kgs overweight, I was of course happy to remove them. The Tarom counter employee was VERY unprofessional and rude to me that it got so intense and I had to involve the police. The police calmed me down and told me that it is just a language (english language) misunderstanding. Then, I managed my luggage to be exactly 23 kgs and I went to check-in again, with her colleague. It was the end of her shift, she saw me from far away and came to me screaming: YOU CALLED THE POLICE TO ME! Her colleague was trying to calm her down, then she repeated her same sentence again, I told her that I do not want to have a discussion with her and that her colleague is managing my things now, but she insisted, out of the blue, on making my personal item included in my 10 kgs carry-on. Her colleague talked with her, I unfortunately don't understand romanian, but one could tell he was not ok with her attitude. I told her that it is not ok, and she was so loud that her chef came, I honestly thought it is going to be better when her chef deals with the situation, but it got worse, he told me: I have 2 options in order to allow me to 'take' the flight, either to make carry-on PLUS my personal bag 10 kgs, or to pay 65 euro BECAUSE \"THEY ARE NOT SURE ABOUT MY BEHAVIOR THAT CAN HARM OTHER PASSENGERS', otherwise I am not ok to take this flight. I mean literally 65 euros or my behavior is dangerous.. I told him what he is saying is not ok and that he is using his power (he kept repeating the whole time that he is the responsible person for the flight) to cover his colleague's mistake, and when I called my embassy to take care of the situation, he did not accept to take the call and said to 'send an email and we will check it later'. Finally, when I took my boarding pass from them after making my carry-on PLUS personal items the weight they need (completely nonsense), one of the employees came AGAIN after me to the security check area and asked me to go back to the counter because she needs to re-check my carry-on after asking me if I added anything after taking my boarding pass. She checked it, it was the same thing and I left! I was so disappointed from the first moment the employee started talking with me in a really rude way and then her chef covering her in front of the police by applying his power on me and not allowing me to be on the plane. Then I checked the reviews here, and found that it is not personal and they are terrible to most of the people! NEVER, EVER EVER!",

    "text": "Absolute WORST Airline in the history of bad airlines! I booked a flight booked for July 26th with KLM from Bucharest -> Panama city Panama with a layover in Amsterdam, and a confirmation for my dog to travel in the hold. Arrived at 5am to Henri Coanda, waiting in line to check in, (the flight board displayed my flight was as scheduled) and a Tarom representative informed me my flight to Amsterdam was cancelled! No email no advance warning and no reason given, just cancelled. They tried to insist I had to deal with KLM for replacement flights, went back and forth between the two Airline counters, KLM confirmed it was definitely Taroms obligation. Finally 8 hours in the airport later the woman seemed to find a suitable replacement flight thru AirFrance which would accept my dog in the hold (which Tarom confirmed). Finally went back to my hotel and decided to call AirFrance just to make sure. AirFrance said absolutely NO WAY could my dog be accepted in hold for the flight because it had a layover in Paris and due to some ridiculous C19 restrictions AirFrance only accepted pets in hold for direct transit flights. So I called the Tarom ticket desk and was told they would go over to AirFrance booth , inquire, and call me back. No one called back. So I called and called, and finally reached an extremely RUDE man, who refused to even provide his name, and tersely said \"as you already had a confirmation for your pet with your original flight, Tarom is obliged to provide you replacement flights with the same requirements met. Your dog IS confirmed for your flight tomorrow morning. Goodbye.\" I was very calm and polite and there was absolutely no call for his horrendous attitude! Because I'd have to be at the airport at 3am, I really didn't want to risk any more troubles so I decided to go in to Coanda right after the call with the ticket booth (about 8pm) simply to get exactly what he had said to me on the phone, recorded, so I could have some documentation. So when I approached the desk I (stupidly) asked his permission first if I recorded the conversation. He said\"if you want to record me I'll have to call the police\" I said go ahead call the police- and they arrived about 15 minutes later. After explaining the entire situation all over again, the police said, no I could not record audio/video(in that public airport!!) And I should \"go home and get some rest for my flight in the morning\". Arrived the next morning at 2am, no surprise, AirFrance could not accept my dog, back to Tarom ticket desk, same sweaty angry guy still on shift, said \"guess what? AirFrance doesn't accept my dog!\" He immediately started dialing on his phone, then told me again it was Airfrances problem, and while I was speaking to him he said \"Can you just..!!!!\" And I said , no CAN YOU JUST!! I came here at 8pm last night because I know this was going to happen and you did nothing to check into it! And he literally yelled SHUT UP SHUT UP! So I asked when his shift ended, and came back to the ticket desk at that time. There was as different woman working then, who maybe had two marbles rolling around loosely upstairs, who told me they had \"no Tarom managers\" I could speak to, until I fake called my embassy and explained all about being stuck in Romania being tossed around by Tarom, and suddenly after she heard that call, directed me to the Tarom supervisors counter!!!! He at least was helpful and had a neutral attitude rather than snide, angry, impatient, or utterly clueless! He managed to work out a direct flight from Coanda -> France then another direct flight from France to Panama, on the 29th of July. Now as per Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights. -- I am entitled to a 600‚Ç¨ refund per passenger- yet of course can't even make the complaint because the complaint page doesn't even work, won't submit!!!! And they won't answer calls either. Absolute WORST experience ever, I will NEVER fly Tarom again, and I'll do my best to avoid Romania, honestly.",
